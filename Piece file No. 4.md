**DON'T STAND AT MY GRAVE AND WEEP.**

Day to day toils to weaken my strength
Stress from nations of incarnations of inhumanity
walking by me like shadows of darkness
And yes,  its a rest from the iniquities of the world, 
As am worn and weary laid on a resting place, 
So don't stand at my grave and weep
For am in the winter grave giving way to the spring of redemption and the summer of glory.

Weep not, Sing and merry to this day
This day is not a day of sorrow
This day is a day of joy
I'm not dead but gone to the Father
The alter of the most Holy ,  The alter of of paradise
The statue of the most pure emotions that flips like flitches of stars.
So weep not on my grave beloved
As today i rest from all kinds of injustices of the world, 
Don't Stand at my grave and weep
For I'm Gone.

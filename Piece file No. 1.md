**DON'T STAND AT MY GRAVE AND WEEP.**

I am no more
I am the birds singing lullabies up in the sky
I am the roars of thunder at clouds line
I am the winds with tender touch on your skin
I am gone beyond imagination
I won't return at a spin of tears flashing on the form of an ocean,
I am no more to weep for at my Grave.
I am the feathers with no form brightly carried by the winds.

I am in the softly falling droplets of drizzles
I am the radiating light at sun rise and sun set with beautiful feelings
I am the sweet dreams that keep your emotions awake
I am the beginning of your day with the smiles at the mirror
I am the memories of us that never fades
So don't stand at my Grave and weep 
For am in paradise, the one long prophesied about in the book of life.
I am alive not dead my beloved
Don't stand at my Grave and weep.
